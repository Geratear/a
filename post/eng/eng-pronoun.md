### 双重所有格
物主代词不可与a,an,this,that,some,each 等一起前置。只能：

    a/an/this.. + 名词 of 名词性物主代词
    a friend of mine.
    each brother of his.
    
### 人称代词的主宾格
主格(The nominative case)用作主语，宾格(The objective case)用作宾语，所有格(The possessive case)则表示所有之物。

1. I give him a book. 这里的give 是动词，him 是give 的宾语, 就是宾格.I是主格
2. She speaks to me. 这里的to 是介词，它后面的me在英语语法中称宾语，因此也要用宾格。

## 指示代词
指示代词可作主语宾语表语、名词限定：this/that, these/those

that/those（this/these不行）常用于定语从句, 
one 代替可数名词, that代替不可数名词：

    He admired that which looks beautiful.
    他赞赏外表漂亮的东西。
    He admired those who look beautiful.
    他赞赏那些漂亮的人。

1）The weather in China is different from____.
　B. one in America　 D. that in America
  B和D中，B中的one常用来代替可数名词，而that可车以代替不可数或抽象名词，所以选D。

## 反身代词，表示你自己，他自己, 我们自己
形容词性物主代词+self/selves: herself,ourselves, themselves, itself
She  was talking to herself.

反身只可用于宾格，不可用于主格, 除了and/or/nor. 第二个主语要反身：

    Charles and myself saw it .

### 第二人称宾语要反身
You should be proud of yourself

### 有些动词需要反身代词
absent,bathe,amuse,blame,dry,cut,enjoy,hurt,introduce,behave.
1. We enjoyed ourselves very much last night.
2. Please help yourself to some fish. 请你随便吃点鱼

### 可用于及物动+宾(反身)+介词
take pride in, be annoyed with, help oneself to sth.
1. I could not dress (myself) up at that time. 那时我不能打扮我自己。

### 在不强调的情况下，but,except,for 等介词后宾语用反向或人称宾格
